    <div class="motivation-title">Project Overview</div> 
    <div class="motivation-content">Our previous projects were mostly service oriented, so as a team we thought it would be interesting to come up with a design solution that was centered around a physical product rather than a service. With it's rising popularity, the smart speaker was a perfect product for us to identify business challenges that could be turned into opportunities. </div>
    <div class="motivation-content">We looked at the top competitors in the smart speaker market (Amazon Echo, Google Home, and Apple HomePod), researching respective sale statistics and the average smart speaker owner. Although the Amazon Echo is the leading seller of smart speakers, Google Home and other competitors are growing at faster rates and projected to overtake the Amazon Echo in 2018.</div>

<div class="motivation-wrap">
    <div class="motivation-title">Research</div> 
    <div class="motivation-content">Statistics from comScore and canalys show that while the Amazon Echo is the most popular smart speaker in the U.S., Google Home has surpassed Amazon Echo globally, both in market dominance and growth. In the graph below, you can see how the smart speaker market is expected to change. Notice, that both Amazon's competitors and the total market size are growing at an exponential rate.</div>

    <div class="motivation-content">From this data, Amazon Echo is growing at a significantly slower rate than it's competitors. Although the Amazon Echo still stands as a leading option for smart speakers, the introduction of new competition and increase in total market size means that Amazon needs to react in order to remain a viable competitor.</div>

    <div class="motivation-title">Defining the User and Problem</div> 
    <div class="motivation-content">To better understand our target demographic, our team studied statistics on the average amazon owner and interviewed several Echo owners. We found that the average Echo owner was in their early adult life and of middle class economic status. This data was congruent with the profiles of our interviewees and reinforced what our user persona would be.</div>

            </div>
        </div>
    </div>
    <div class="motivation-content">With the results of our sales research, our team was curious whether Amazon's declining growth was due to a potential user problem. We stepped into the shoes of a smart speaker customer. Shopping around for smart speakers we immediately noticed that it was difficult.</div>
